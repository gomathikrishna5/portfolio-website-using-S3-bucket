This project demonstrates the deployment of a personal portfolio website utilizing Amazon Web
Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) Static Website Hosting. The primary objective was to
gain practical experience in hosting static web content on the cloud, enabling global public
accessibility through AWS’s highly available and scalable infrastructure.
The portfolio website was developed using foundational web technologies—HTML, CSS, and various
image assets—ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design suitable for showcasing
professional skills and projects. All website files were uploaded to a dedicated S3 bucket, configured
to serve as a static website endpoint.
Key configurations included enabling static website hosting on the S3 bucket, setting up bucket
policies to permit public read access while maintaining security best practices, and properly defining
index and error document handling. During deployment, common challenges such as HTTP 403
(Forbidden) and 404 (Not Found) errors were identified and systematically resolved by adjusting
access permissions and ensuring accurate file paths.
The result is a fully operational, publicly accessible portfolio website served directly from AWS S3,
eliminating the need for traditional web servers and reducing hosting costs. This project highlights
essential AWS cloud infrastructure skills, including S3 bucket management, policy configuration, and
static website deployment, while simultaneously reinforcing core web development competencies.
Overall, this work illustrates how cloud-native services can be leveraged to efficiently publish
personal branding material online, providing a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective solution for web
hosting. It serves as a foundation for further exploration of AWS services such as CloudFront CDN
integration, domain management via Route 53, and automated deployment pipelines
